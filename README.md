# Phonebook 
## Installation 
Open your terminal and do the following:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
Then simply run __main__.py script. 

## Interface
In Phonebook you have three main buttons: Add, Edit and Remove. 
They have the following functionality:

### Add
Via this button you can open an input window and add your record to the phonebook. 
In input window you have to fill in several lines: **First Name**, **Last Name**, **phone number** and an optinal **birth date** line. 

**NG** First Name and Last Name should always start with a number or a capital letter. Phone number should start with an 8 or +7. The birth date should be in the following format: MM-DD-YYYY

### Edit
Via this button you can edit an existing record. Pretty much the same rules as for Add. 

### Remove 
Via this button you can delete a record, which is currently chosen. 

## Search 
On the bottom of the phonebook window you have a search line. You can input here any piece of information on the record you are searching for and you'll see a list of records, which contain your input.
